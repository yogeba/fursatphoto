The Space
Rated 4.9/⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ from 18 Google reviews, here's what guests say about this soulful stay:

"It's a must-visit for a unique experience in the hills… The first time I had home-cooked food in the local style. Don't expect luxury, but expect love, attention, warmth, and nature in abundance. The soothing sound of the stream, the chirping birds, and delicious traditional food make it unforgettable."

"A beautiful off-grid experience in a stunning natural setting. What truly sets this place apart is the warmth of the Lepcha family. They go above and beyond to make you feel at home. This is real eco-tourism—genuine, immersive, and impactful."

"Nestled amidst an abandoned tea estate, the cozy cottage exceeded all expectations. Umesh da's hospitality and his addictive tea made our stay feel like home. The village walk and river hike were highlights. We'll definitely return."

"A culturally immersive experience like no other. From the guided walks to heartfelt meals, every moment felt authentic. I felt safe, seen, and surrounded by kindness. The connection I made with the host family and their daughter—even without a shared language—was deeply moving."

    if (!reviews || reviews.length === 0) {
      return NextResponse.json(

        { status: 500 }
      );
    }

    // Format reviews for the prompt
    const reviewsText = reviews
      .map((review: PlaceReview) => {
        return `- "${review.text}" (Rating: ${review.rating}/5, by ${review.author_name})`;

${contextInfo}

Remember:
- Do NOT use the actual place name "${placeName || "the property"}" in the title or description
- Create a compelling, SEO-friendly title
- Use the exact format structure from the sample
- Extract real quotes from the reviews provided
- Infer amenities and experiences from what reviewers mention
- Keep the warm, inviting tone
- AVOID generic overused terms like: serene, tranquil, nestled, tucked away, hidden gem, oasis, paradise, picturesque, quaint, idyllic, breathtaking, stunning, magical, enchanting, escape, retreat, getaway, rejuvenate, unwind
- Instead use SPECIFIC, CONCRETE descriptions from the actual reviews - mention real details like specific birds, rivers, tea gardens, food items, activities that guests actually experienced
- Be authentic and grounded, not flowery or cliché
- USE THE ACTUAL WORDS AND PHRASES from the reviews as much as possible - if a guest says "addictive tea" use that exact phrase, if they mention "village walk" or "range officer" include those specific terms
- Mirror the voice and language of real guests to keep it authentic
- Include Airbnb SEO keywords naturally: location-specific terms, property type (cottage, bungalow, guest house), nearby attractions, experience types (eco-tourism, nature stay, homestay), amenities mentioned
- Use searchable terms guests would type: "near [landmark]", "[activity] in [region]", "family-friendly", "couples", "solo travelers", "pet-friendly" if applicable

AFTER the listing description, add a separator line "---PROPERTY_DATA---" and then output a JSON object with property details you can extract from the reviews.

CRITICAL RULES for the JSON:
- Return null for ANY field where the information is NOT clearly stated in reviews
- Do NOT guess or hallucinate room counts, bed counts, bathroom counts, guest capacity, or pricing — these are almost NEVER reliably mentioned in reviews and will be manually entered
- Only set wifi/hotWater/petsAllowed to true if a guest EXPLICITLY mentions using them
- For stateCity, extract ONLY if a guest mentions the city/state/region name
- For otherAmenities, ONLY list things guests specifically describe experiencing (e.g. "swimming pool", "bonfire area", "parking")
- When in doubt, return null. False data is worse than no data.

JSON format:
{"totalRooms":null,"beds":null,"bathrooms":null,"guests":null,"pricingType":null,"wifi":true/false/null,"hotWater":true/false/null,"petsAllowed":true/false/null,"stateCity":"name or null","otherAmenities":"comma-separated or null"}`;
