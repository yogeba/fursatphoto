Remember:
- Do NOT use the actual place name "${placeName || "the property"}" in the title or description
- Create a compelling, SEO-friendly title
- Use the exact format structure from the sample
- Extract real quotes from the reviews provided
- Infer amenities and experiences from what reviewers mention
- Keep the warm, inviting tone
- NEVER use em dashes or long dashes anywhere. Use commas, periods, or colons instead.
- NO blank lines between bullet points. All bullets in a section must be consecutive.
- Use clear section headers: The Space, Guest Access, Room Types, Experiences & Activities, Getting There, Other Things to Note
- AVOID generic overused terms like: serene, tranquil, nestled, tucked away, hidden gem, oasis, paradise, picturesque, quaint, idyllic, breathtaking, stunning, magical, enchanting, escape, retreat, getaway, rejuvenate, unwind
- Instead use SPECIFIC, CONCRETE descriptions from the actual reviews - mention real details like specific birds, rivers, tea gardens, food items, activities that guests actually experienced
- Be authentic and grounded, not flowery or cliché
- USE THE ACTUAL WORDS AND PHRASES from the reviews as much as possible - if a guest says "addictive tea" use that exact phrase, if they mention "village walk" or "range officer" include those specific terms
- Mirror the voice and language of real guests to keep it authentic
- Include Airbnb SEO keywords naturally: location-specific terms, property type (cottage, bungalow, guest house), nearby attractions, experience types (eco-tourism, nature stay, homestay), amenities mentioned
- Use searchable terms guests would type: "near [landmark]", "[activity] in [region]", "family-friendly", "couples", "solo travelers", "pet-friendly" if applicable

AFTER the listing description, add a separator line "---PROPERTY_DATA---" and then output a JSON object with property details you can extract from the reviews.

CRITICAL RULES for the JSON:
- Return null for ANY field where the information is NOT clearly stated in reviews
- Do NOT guess or hallucinate room counts, bed counts, bathroom counts, guest capacity, or pricing — these are almost NEVER reliably mentioned in reviews and will be manually entered
- Only set wifi/hotWater/petsAllowed to true if a guest EXPLICITLY mentions using them
- For stateCity, extract ONLY if a guest mentions the city/state/region name
- For otherAmenities, ONLY list things guests specifically describe experiencing (e.g. "swimming pool", "bonfire area", "parking")
- When in doubt, return null. False data is worse than no data.

JSON format:
{"totalRooms":null,"beds":null,"bathrooms":null,"guests":null,"pricingType":null,"wifi":true/false/null,"hotWater":true/false/null,"petsAllowed":true/false/null,"stateCity":"name or null","otherAmenities":"comma-separated or null"}`;
